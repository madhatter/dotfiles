These are my config files I use everyday.
If you find something useful feel free to copy it. The main purpose is to
backup the files and track changes made when transfered to different clients.

Right now it's the configuration on my Mac OS X 10.6 client. 
A few paths would be different on my Linux or BSD box.

Questions or ideas are welcome.

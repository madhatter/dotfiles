These are my config files I use everyday.
If you find something useful feel free to copy it. The main purpose is to
backup the files and track changes made when transfered to different clients.

The master branch contains everything that might be usefull for everybody.
The other branches are used for keeping track of changes made in different
environments.

Questions or ideas are welcome.
